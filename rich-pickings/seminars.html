      <h1>Seminars</h1>
      <h4 class="progTime">Keynote address</h4>
      <h2>The role of the Groceries Code Adjudicator</h2>
      <h3>Christine Tacon CBE – Groceries Code Adjudicator<strong></strong></h3>
      <p align="left">The Groceries Code Adjudicator was established by an Act of Parliament on June 25th 2013. </p>
      <p align="left">The Groceries Supply Code of Practice (the Code) was established in February 2010 following two Competition Commission inquiries. The Code sets out standards of fair dealing between direct suppliers and the ten retailers with an annual UK groceries turnover &gt;£1bn. The Code requires these retailers to have contracts with their direct suppliers and prohibits a range of practices which the Competition Commission investigated and reported as having an adverse effect on competition in the groceries sector and on consumers. The Code does not cover price negotiations but includes for example requiring retailers to pay on time and prohibiting variations to contracts without due notice and retrospective discounts. </p>
      <p align="left">The Adjudicator was established because some suppliers felt unable to complain directly to retailers about breaches of the Code, for fear of adverse consequences. The Adjudicator can launch investigations into suspected breaches of the Code where this is supported by evidence, protecting the anonymity of complainants. The Adjudicator has a range of enforcement measures available, including the power to fine retailers if it is found that they have breached the Code, although this will only be used in the most serious cases.</p>

      <p>Brands hold the potential for strong commercial and competitive success in both home and export markets.
